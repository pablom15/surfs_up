## Challenge Written Analysis
The data results for this challenge can be found in the climate_analysis_challenge.ipynb notebook. The written analysis states the following:

This analysis compares precipitation data for the months of June and December from the data provided in "hawaii.sqlite". Firstly, it is concluded that there are 169 more days of rain accounted for in June versus December when looking at the count of data entries across both months. Therefore, it is more likely to have a rainy day in June versus December. December has a higher average amount of precipitation and also has a higher standard deviation. Therefore, we can conclude that June has more rainy days but they average closer to the mean of .14 while December has less rainy days, but a higher average amount of precipitation when it does rain, with a mean of .22. The mean temperature for June and December is 75 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. There is not much of a temperature difference between the two months which is ideal for business. For further analysis I would recommend grouping by station and comparing precipitation and temperature statistics across each station. I would also recommend comparing other months of the season such as January and July.
